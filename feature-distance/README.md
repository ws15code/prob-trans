## Scripts to assess the feature distance between foreign phoneme inventories and English
The script `choose-foreign.R` can be run from the terminal (`Rscript choose-foreign.R`) and outputs ordered lists of the mean “one-to-many” value for each language. See the comments within the script itself for further details. There are some intermediate objects created that may be of interest; if so, the script can be run interactively in your favorite R IDE (alternatively, tell @drammock what you want and he can edit the script to dump .tsv files for you).

### Notes
1. The phonemicization of English used here is from the Stanford Phonology Archive. FYI it is slightly odd in its representation of English vowels.
2. The PHOIBLE data used here is a dump from [this specific commit of the PHOIBLE dev repo](https://github.com/phoible/phoible/commit/cf0042299188e6e94d7a610ff32702e340f2ec80). Note that PHOIBLE uses a pseudo-binary feature system comprising `- + 0` that encodes feature heirarchy (i.e., a phoneme that is `- coronal` will be zero-valued for all features subsumed under `coronal`, such as `strident`). PHOIBLE also makes use of “contour features” for the more complex phonemes, so values like `-,+ high` are possible for speech sounds that are phonologically a single unit but phonetically change quality over time.
